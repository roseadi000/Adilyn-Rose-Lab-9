        <h2><br/>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love to play soccer and have been playing since I was three. In fourth 
            grade, I joined a competative soccer team-- Utah Soccer Alliance (USA). I
            also played for my high school team. Unfortunetly, I can't play as much as
            I used to, but I might start reffing to stay involved with the game.</p>
        <p>I also love to read, write, and draw. My favorite book series is <em>
            Skyward</em> by Brandon Sanderson. I'm currently reading <em>The Lord of 
            the Rings: The Two Towers</em> by J.R.R Tolkien. I also love to play video
            games. My favorite series are <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Metroid.</em>
        </p>

        <h2><br/>Family</h2>
        <p>In my family, there are six people: my parents, me, and three other sisters. 
            Of them, I'm the second oldest, only younger than my twin sister. My family
            also has a dog, a husky named Shasta, and a bunny named Black Berry.</p>

        <h2><br/>Education</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am a student at Brigham Young Univeristy. I'm a junior studying 
            computer science, and I'm exploring minor options. I expect to graduate 
            April, 2028.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Copper Hills High School. During my senior year, I took a 
            class at the Jordan Academy for Technology and Careers. That class had a 
            lot of hands on learning and was a lot of fun.</p>
